This is a final project created for an Intro to Python course at USF

Part of this course included the blog linked below:

This program was created to simulate the biological processes of transcription from a DNA sequence to a RNA sequence and the translation of a RNA sequence into an amino acid chain from a txt file that would contain an original series of DNA nucleotides represented by a sequence of "G", "C", "A", and "T" characters. The main.py file contains two functions that serve as simulations of transcription and translation to produce a RNA sequence and its translated amino acids when given a DNA sequence such as sample_DNA.txt that is included.
